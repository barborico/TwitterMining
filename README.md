# TwitterMining
A web app to stream tweets based on content and location.

Run WebApp.py to locally run a basic webpage that handles streaming inputs (filters) and outputs (tweets).
There are placeholders for the API keys in TwitterStreaming.py; these must be replaced before attempting streaming.

TwitterMiningOld.py is an earlier version that runs on a desktop, reading inputs from and storing outputs to text files.
